- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Proper type definitions for all props and data
- **Tailwind CSS**: Consistent styling with the existing design system
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint-specific layouts
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Performance**: Optimized re-renders and efficient state updates

## Key Features Implemented

### Real-time Updates
- Both components simulate real-time data updates
- Configurable refresh intervals
- Loading states during updates
- Timestamp tracking for last update

### Interactive Elements
- Clickable refresh buttons
- Hover effects and transitions
- Action buttons for extended functionality
- Responsive grid layouts

### Visual Indicators
- Color-coded status indicators
