## Recommended Structure Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Organize code by feature or layer
- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent naming conventions
- **Logical Grouping**: Group related files and modules together
- **Scalability**: Structure should support project growth

## Common Patterns
Depending on technology choice, consider these organizational patterns:
- **Feature-based**: Group by business functionality
- **Layer-based**: Separate by technical concerns (UI, business logic, data)
- **Domain-driven**: Organize around business domains
- **Modular**: Independent, reusable components

## Configuration Files
Keep configuration files at project root:
- Environment-specific configs
- Build and tooling configurations
- Documentation (README, CHANGELOG)
- Dependency management files

## Documentation
Maintain clear documentation structure:
- README.md at project root
- API documentation where applicable
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Setup and deployment guides
