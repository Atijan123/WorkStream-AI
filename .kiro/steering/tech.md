Atlas is in initial setup phase with no technology stack currently defined.

## Recommended Practices
When selecting technologies, prioritize:

- Performance and scalability considerations
- Developer experience and tooling

## Build System Guidelines
Once a tech stack is chosen, ensure:

- Automated testing integration
- Clear dependency management
- Environment-specific configurations

## Common Commands
To be defined based on chosen technology stack. Typical patterns include:
- `build` - Compile/build the project
- `test` - Run test suites
- `dev` - Start development server
- `lint` - Code quality checks
- `format` - Code formatting
