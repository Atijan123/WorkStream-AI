# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Self-Evolving Workflow Automator is a dashboard application that can dynamically evolve its own UI features and automate workflows based on natural-language requests. The system integrates a universal workflow automator with a self-evolving spec-to-code pipeline powered by Kiro, enabling users to request new features and workflows through natural language, which are then automatically implemented and deployed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to submit natural-language requests for new UI features, so that the dashboard can automatically evolve and add the functionality I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a natural-language feature request THEN the system SHALL display a text input box for feature requests
2. WHEN a user submits a feature request THEN the system SHALL trigger the `evolve_ui` hook to process the request
3. WHEN the `evolve_ui` hook is triggered THEN the system SHALL update the application spec and regenerate UI components
4. WHEN new UI components are generated THEN the system SHALL integrate them into the existing dashboard without requiring manual deployment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create workflows using natural language, so that I can automate repetitive tasks without writing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the workflow builder THEN the system SHALL provide a natural-language interface for workflow creation
2. WHEN a user submits a workflow request THEN the system SHALL trigger the `automate_workflow` hook
3. WHEN the `automate_workflow` hook is triggered THEN the system SHALL append structured workflows to the spec
4. WHEN workflows are added to the spec THEN the system SHALL generate backend automation code automatically
5. WHEN workflows are created THEN the system SHALL support cron-based scheduling triggers
6. WHEN workflows execute THEN the system SHALL support actions including data fetching, report generation, email sending, system monitoring, and logging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a central dashboard view, so that I can monitor my widgets, active workflows, and recent system changes in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard home THEN the system SHALL display a central view with widgets, active workflows, and evolution logs
2. WHEN workflows are running THEN the system SHALL show their current status on the dashboard
3. WHEN the system evolves (adds new features or workflows) THEN the system SHALL log these changes and display them in the recent changes section
4. WHEN users interact with the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates of workflow statuses and system metrics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want predefined workflows to run automatically, so that routine tasks like reporting and monitoring are handled without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL initialize with predefined workflows including daily sales reports and hourly system health checks
2. WHEN it is 8 AM daily THEN the system SHALL execute the daily sales report workflow
3. WHEN the daily sales report runs THEN the system SHALL fetch sales data, generate a PDF report, and email it to sales@company.com
4. WHEN it is the top of each hour THEN the system SHALL execute the system health check workflow
5. WHEN the system health check runs THEN the system SHALL check CPU and memory usage and log the results
6. IF any workflow fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue operating other workflows

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system built with modern web technologies, so that it is maintainable, scalable, and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is implemented THEN the frontend SHALL be built using React
2. WHEN the system is implemented THEN the backend SHALL be built using Node.js
3. WHEN the system stores data THEN it SHALL use SQLite as the database
4. WHEN the system renders UI THEN it SHALL use Tailwind CSS for styling
5. WHEN the system architecture is designed THEN it SHALL support modular components that can be dynamically added and removed
